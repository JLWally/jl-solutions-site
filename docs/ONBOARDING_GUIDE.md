## 1. Watch the welcome video

Take 3 minutes to watch the welcome video (on the [Onboarding](/portal/onboarding#welcome-video) page in the portal). It covers what we offer and who we’re for.

## 2. Decide what you need

- **Fix my app** — Something’s broken or slow. We fix it.
- **Manage my app** — You want updates, hosting, and monitoring handled.
- **Create an app** — You have an idea; we build and launch it.
- **AI automation** — You want chatbots, workflows, or AI in your app.
- **Free consultation** — Not sure? Book a free 30-minute call.
