# Deploying jlsolutions.io

- **Publish directory:** Must be **`public`** in Netlify (Site settings → Build & deploy → Build settings).
- **Branch:** `main`.
- **Academy** lives in a separate repo/site (e.g. academy.jlsolutions.io); this repo’s `public` folder does not include the Academy.
- If you still see the old site or Academy here, in Netlify use **Clear cache and deploy site** (Deploys → Trigger deploy).
